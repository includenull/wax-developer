title: WAX Hyperion Streaming with a WAX Load Balancer
---
WAX Hyperion Full History is awesome for running lightning fast queries on historical indexed data, however certain dApps, Applications and specific use cases require a live view of indexed data. Hyperion is quite capable of providing this through a feature called streaming.

The Hyperion Streaming feature is quite simply enabled in the  `wax.config.json`  file and can be accessed and utilised using the  [EOS RIO Hyperion Stream Client](https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-stream-client).

A common issue encountered after enabling this streaming feature on a production WAX Hyperion Full History service is that it simply won’t work when situated behind a load balancer. The reason for this is that Hyperion streaming uses a websocket connection on a non standard port by default and ideally requires the load balancer to be configured and listening for websocket upgrade requests.

This next sub-article in the series will describe how to enable and configure Hyperion streaming using websockets on  [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/).

EOS RIO have an excellent  [Hyperion Documentation Repository](https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io/)  including details on how to run their Hyperion Full History product, however this article will expand on their current documentation.

Once again this Technical How To series will cover some of EOS RIO’s same content and will add operational nuances from a practical stand point and our experience.

# WAX Hyperion Streaming with a WAX Load Balancer

Websockets create a full duplex connection between client and server over a single TCP connection which is utilised by the Hyperion streaming feature. In order to provide load balancing and redundancy of this streaming service, a reverse proxy that supports websockets is needed.

HAProxy has a very neat automated ability to upgrade an existing HTTP connection to a TCP websocket using  **Connection: Upgrade**  and  **Upgrade: websocket**  **HTTP headers**  it can also be configured to simply recognise a specific  **URL**  that will point directly to the websocket server or streaming service in this case.

Once the websocket TCP tunnel connection is made, it will stay up until one of the nodes terminates or until the session timeout is reached. Below is a diagram I borrowed from HAPrroxy to visualise the setup flow.

Websocket flow and timeouts of each phase

You can read more about  [Websockets Load Balancing with HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/websockets-load-balancing-with-haproxy/)  on the HAProxy website.

In my research I also read a good article on troubleshooting  [Websocket/HAProxy timeouts](https://lucjan.medium.com/investigating-websocket-haproxy-reconnecting-and-timeouts-6d19cc0002a1), your mileage may vary when using State-History nodes but it may be advantageous to configure a specific tunnel timeout. Ours is set to 35 seconds in the HAProxy defaults section as below.

```
defaults  
timeout tunnel  35000
```

In this example HAProxy will be configured to recognise a websocket connection+upgrade header and direct these requests to a Hyperion streaming server, if your deployment has more than one Hyperion streaming API these requests will be load balanced.

Be sure to review "How to Set Up a Reliable WAX Load Balancer" for details on how to build and configure HAProxy in it’s entirety.

# Configuration

In this example the goal is to:

-   Enable streaming on the Hyperion API server
-   Configure the HAProxy frontend to recognise traffic based on URL and Connect+Upgrade HTTP Header (frontend is a public IP and backend is a private LAN)
-   Configure the frontend to route traffic to the appropriate backend Hyperion streaming API based on websocket traffic.
-   Configure the front end to accept either websocket  `ws:`  or websocket secure  `wss:`  connections.  _The_ `wss:` _protocol establishes a WebSocket over an encrypted TLS connection, while the_ `ws:` _protocol uses an unencrypted connection._
-   Configure backend servers, load balance algorithm and thresholds

## Hyperion Configuration

Streaming is enabled in the  `wax.config.json`  file as per below

```
> nano wax.config.json  
  
  "features": {  
    "streaming": {  
      "enable": true,  
      "traces": true,  
      "deltas": true  
    },
```

By default the streaming websocket port is  `:1234`  which is what we use but can be manually changed as below

```
> nano wax.config.json  
  
"api":  
 "stream_port": 1234,  
 "stream_scroll_limit": -1,  
 "stream_scroll_batch": 500
```

Once configured, restart the Hyperion Indexer and Hyperion API PM2 process

```
> cd ~/hyperion-history-api  

> pm2 start --only wax-indexer --update-env  

> pm2 start --only wax-api --update-env
```
The streaming service can be tested locally by running the below command

```
> curl 127.0.0.1:1234/stream/  
  
{"code":0,"message":"Transport unknown"}
```

## HAProxy Configuration

HAProxy configuration is found in  `haproxy.cfg`, follow the below to configure each section

```
> sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```
**frontend**

Configure an access-list called  `wax_acl`  to recognise normal HTTP requests for your URL, in this case  `wax.eosphere.io`. And then configure two access-lists one for recognising a connection upgrade request  `wax_con_upg_acl`  and one to recognise an upgrade to websocket request  `wax_ws_upg_acl`.

```
frontend http-in  
acl wax_acl hdr(host) -i wax.eosphere.io  
  
acl wax_con_upg_acl hdr(Connection)  -i upgrade  
acl wax_ws_upg_acl  hdr(Upgrade)     -i websocket  
  
##Alternatively a websocket specific URL rather than a dynamic upgrade can be used to point all traffic to your state-history servers##  
  
acl wax_acl hdr(host) -i ws-wax.eosphere.io
```

Bind the above access-list to a backend server group specifying the Hyperion streaming websocket and normal HTTP API’s server groups. In this example the following is configured.

-   Normal v1 API queries are sent to the  `wax_api_servers`  backend
-   Websocket traffic is sent to the  `wax_hyperion_streaming_servers`  backend

```
use_backend wax_api_servers if wax_acl { path_beg /v1/chain }  
use_backend wax_api_servers if wax_acl { path_beg /v1/node/get_supported_apis }  
  
use_backend wax_hyperion_streaming_servers if wax_acl wax_con_upg_acl wax_ws_upg_acl
```

If you have configured your HAProxy to accept HTTPS on port :443 and provide SSL Offloading (please see "How to Set Up a Reliable WAX Load Balancer" for details) your reverse proxy will accept  `wss:`  as well as  `ws:`  connections.

**backend**

Configure the backend server groups to match your infrastructure and apply specific policies for each server group, in this case HTTP API servers and Hyperion streaming websocket servers.

The configuration below provides example servers and policy to match the above configuration. In particular the  `wax_hyperion_streaming_servers`  are configured to be checked if available (they will be marked as down and not used if unavailable) with a maximum of 200 connections specified.

```
backend wax_api_servers  
    balance roundrobin  
    default-server check maxconn 10000  
    server wax-pn-1 <PRIVATE LAN IP>:8888 cookie server1 weight 1              
    server wax-pn-2 <PRIVATE LAN IP>:8888 cookie server2 weight 1              
    server wax-pn-3 <PRIVATE LAN IP>:8888 cookie server3 weight 4  
  
backend wax_hyperion_streaming_servers  
    balance leastconn  
    default-server check maxconn 200  
    server wax-hyperion-api-1 <PRIVATE LAN IP>:1234 cookie server1 weight 1             
    server wax-hyperion-api-2 <PRIVATE LAN IP>:1234 cookie server2 weight 1
```

`balance leastconn`  is used for the Hyperion streaming servers in this example as it seems to be better method to balance long lasting connections for our experience.

And that is it, your Hyperion streaming service is ready for public use.

Of course there are many of ways for you to setup websocket load balancing and resiliency for WAX services, the example in this article is how we are currently configured at EOSphere and will give you enough detail to be able to customise for your own deployment.
