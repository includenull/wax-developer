# How to Submit a WAX Labs Proposal

## 1. Ensure the Project Qualifies to Receive Funding

While the scope of the project proposal can encompass a broad range of disciplines such as marketing, network infrastructure, events, governance tools, developer tools and more, there is one major requirement that must be met by the project proposal.

The only hard requirement for WAX Labs is that the project is non-profit and provides community benefit. Below are some examples of projects that do and do not qualify. If  unsure if the project qualifies please reach out to the [WAX Office of the Inspector General](https://oig.wax.io) or ask in the WAX Labs telegram channel (@waxlabs).

**Projects that qualify as non-profit projects**

- Funding to host a WAX community meetup
- Open source (ex: MIT) code/tools/features that are built with a for-profit use case in mind
- Public APIs
- Creation of educational and/or developer materials (written, videos, a platform)

**Projects that DO NOT qualify as non-profit projects**

- Requests for formal sponsorship for an industry conference
- Funding to port a for-profit game to WAX or WAX EVM
- Funding for giveaways/contests for a for-profit game or project

## 2. Create a WAX Account & Complete WAX Labs Profile

Ensure that the proposer has a WAX account. If one is needed, the proposer can create an account using the WAX Cloud Wallet or various other wallet providers.

Log in to the WAX Labs and complete the profile by clicking on the WAX account name in the top right. Make sure that the profile is memorable and detailed to increase the chances of a successful proposal.

## 3. Prepare the Proposal

Proposers should spend an ample amount of time crafting a detailed proposal that outlines the project. The following items should be addressed in the proposal:

- The problem, deficiency, or opportunity within the ecosystem that has been identified where the project can provide value
- A detailed description of the project
- Project management timelines structured as milestone deliverables
- Proposed license (if applicable)
- Tech stack (if applicable)
- Proposal team & experience

An example successful proposal template can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jC8fIuwZMIjDkZqvUmg58Cp_vRpwofDwLQIZnJC8icg/edit?usp=sharing).


Projects that are highly quality, polished (ex: an eye-catching cover image), and have done up-front research, preparation, or mockup work are more likely to be approved.

The character limit of various fields are provided below:
- Title - 64 characters
- Description - 160 characters
- Content - 4,096 characters*
- Financial Roadmap - 4,096 characters*

**It is recommended to limit these fields to 3750 characters max because WAX Labs adds additional characters when converting to markdown format.*

## 4. Submit the Draft Proposal

Fill out the submission form, providing all the required information. Additional materials may be provided by linking to them within the content and financial roadmap sections. The platform will automatically convert the proposal submission to markdown upon submission.

A small fee of 100 WAX tokens is required on draft submission to prevent spam on the platform.

It’s okay if the proposal is not finished in one sitting. The WAX Labs platform saves the proposal once it is submitted as a draft. However, be aware that anything saved as a draft can be viewed by others with the WAX Labs platform and the smart contract directly through a block explorer. Most proposers find it easiest to write the proposal in a word processor first and then transfer it to the submission form when they are ready to submit

## 5. Add Deliverables to Draft Proposal

After the proposal draft is created, the proposer will need to return to the draft proposal and add the deliverables and their expected time to completion.

Amounts requested on deliverables are pegged to USD and the WAX amount rewarded is frozen at the time the deliverable is approved by the WAX team.

## 6. Submit Final Proposal, Wait for Review, and Engage with the Community

Once the deliverables are added, the proposal can be submitted to review to the Inspector Generals to begin the review process.

The review process for WAX Labs proposals generally takes 1 month after submission. The Inspector Generals serve as the first reviewer of the WAX Labs proposals to determine whether or not the project meets the non-profit requirement and that it is a quality proposal based on the various factors outlined in Step 3. The Inspector Generals meet with the WAX team twice per month to review Labs proposals and proposal deliverables 

Throughout the process, especially during the waiting period, the proposer should build their reputation by actively participating in the WAX community. This can include participating in discussions in WAX Telegram groups, Discord servers, and X Spaces. Proposers should socialize their proposals with prominent community members to obtain feedback and display professionalism when being a part of the community. It is in the proposer’s best interest to begin participating in the community well before submitting their proposal to allow the Inspector Generals to get to know them and increase their chances of approval.

Proposers and other community members can sign up to receive Telegram notifications about proposals by using the WAX Labs bot (@waxlabsbot). Proposers should also receive an email to the provided address when the status of the proposal is changed by the OIG.

## 7. Respond to Feedback

Proposals can either be Approved, Rejected, or placed in the “To Be Improved” stage. This stage requires the proposer to edit and resubmit the proposal with additional information.

A member of the Inspector Generals should reach out to the proposer at the provided telegram handle or email address to further discuss the feedback on the proposal. If they do not reach out, proposers can reach out to them directly at the Office of the Inspector General website or in the WAX Labs telegram channel (@waxlabs).

After making the discussed changes, the proposer must resubmit the proposal to receive a new decision at the next review meeting. Proposals that incorporate all of the feedback have a higher chance of being approved when resubmitted.

## 8. Receive Approval or Rejection

If the proposal is approved, the proposer is in the clear to begin executing on the project. Follow any additional instructions for project execution and reporting requested by the Inspector Generals.

If the proposal is rejected, proposers can reach out to the Inspector Generals to receive additional feedback about why the proposal was rejected. If a proposal is rejected, it could potentially be approved in the future if improved and resubmitted.

## 9. Complete Deliverables and Claim Funding

Funding is only dispersed to project owners once a deliverable is fully completed and approved by the OIG after review with the WAX team. Completion reports are submitted by logging into the WAX account that submitted the proposal and visiting the “Deliverables” tab on the In Progress proposal page. Deliverables only require the submission of a URL, which can generally be a written update in a publicly accessible google doc (like this one), the github commit log of the project, or link to a demo or finished product.

In the event that claiming funding fails, please reach out to the Office of Inspector General. The funding account most likely needs to be topped up by the WAX team before funds can be claimed.
