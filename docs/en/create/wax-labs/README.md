# WAX Labs Overview

[WAX Labs](https://labs.wax.io) is an innovation hub that uses a worker proposal program to fund non-profit projects that produce innovations on the WAX blockchain or provide a significant public good to the networkâ€™s users. Worker proposal programs, unlike Request for Proposals (RFPs) are bottom-up coming from developers, small teams, or companies, rather than top-down coming from WAX itself.
